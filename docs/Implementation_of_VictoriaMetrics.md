# Implementation of VictoriaMetrics

VictoriaMetrics can be deployed using Helm charts, with the victoria-metrics-k8s-stack being a popular choice. This stack includes VictoriaMetrics Operator, Grafana, and kube-state-metrics.

To deploy VictoriaMetrics, follow these steps:
1. Add repositories for dependencies: Grafana and Prometheus-community.
2. Add the VictoriaMetrics repository and update.
3. Create a configuration file specifying Helm chart values.
4. Deploy the stack to a Kubernetes namespace using Helm.

Once deployed, verify the installation by checking the pods and application status. The stack provides essential components for monitoring Kubernetes clusters, along with scraping configurations for various services.
