## Step 2: Installation and Setup

### Add Helm Repositories:
```bash
$ helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
$ helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
$ helm repo add vm https://victoriametrics.github.io/helm-charts/
$ helm repo update
```


## Create Configuration:
Prepare a configuration file (monitoring-values.yaml) with necessary settings for components like victoria-metrics-operator, alertmanager, vmalert, vmagent, and grafana.


## Deploy to Kubernetes:

```bash
$ helm upgrade --install victoria-metrics-k8s-stack -n monitoring --create-namespace vm/victoria-metrics-k8s-stack -f monitoring-values.yaml
```

## Step 3: Verification
### Check Pods:
Ensure that VictoriaMetrics pods are running successfully.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n monitoring | grep victoria
```

### Check Application Status:
Confirm the deployment status and version history.

```bash
$ helm list -f victoria-metrics -n monitoring
$ helm history victoria-metrics -n monitoring
```
